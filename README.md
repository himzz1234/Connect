Welcome to the Connect project repository! Connect is a dynamic social media application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack along with Socket.io for real-time messaging functionality. This platform enables users to create accounts, connect with others, view posts, send messages, and much more.
